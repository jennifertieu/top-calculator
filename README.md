The Odin Project Calculator

https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator

# Requirements
1. Create functions for all the basic math operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
2. Create a new function `operate` that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls a function to perform a math operation.
3. Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the math operation functions, and an equals key. Add a clear button.
4. Create the functions that populate the display when a button is clicked.
5. Make the calculator perform an operation when the user presses the "=" key.
6. Gotchas to watch out for. Users should be able to string together several operations. The calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Round answers with long decimals. Handle zero division and pressing "=" before all the numbers and operators are entered.
